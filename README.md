# PathFindingWithYouBot
Implementing path finding algorithm for KUKA youBot in known environment

**Main programming language:**  C++


**TODO:**
1. Generate a grid map with predefined size
2. Generate starting point, target, obstacles
3. Implement pathfinding algorithm
4. Use image from camera and with fiducial markers to generate grid map
...


***General idea**: use A-star algorithm for generating an initial path, then use D-star lite algorithm for updating the path when the robot moves.*
